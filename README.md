# Analysis: How redistricting helped Nevada Democrats â€” but not enough to gain supermajority
### The Nevada Independent

## Data Collection:

The Nevada Independent analyzed the effects of redistricting using two datasets from the Clark County Elections Department: a voter registration file and a database of all voters in the 2024 general election.

Clark County's voter registration file shows all registered voters in Clark County, including a voter's name, registration number, party affiliation, assigned congressional and legislative districts and address. The voting file from the 2024 election shows all residents whose votes were counted, including their name, registration number and voting method.

To start, these two datasets were combined into a single database by joining both files by registration number. This allowed us to remove anyone who did not vote, while also keeping a voter's address and personal information in a single file.

The Indy's analysis then had two main aspects: determining a district's partisan lean under the current district boundaries and what a district's partisan lean would have been under the former district boundaries. The analysis of the former was simple: because the voter registration file includes a voter's party and assigned legislative and congressional districts, we were able to determine what percent of voters in each district was a registered Democrat, Republican or nonpartisan.

To determine a district's partisan breakdown under the former boundaries, The Indy conducted a spatial analysis. We imported shapefiles of the previous legislative and congressional boundaries from the U.S. Census Bureau. We then converted the residential addresses of all 2024 voters into coordinates using the website geocod.io and conducted a spatial join to determine which old district boundary each address would have fallen under. This allowed us to determine the partisan breakdown of 2024 voters under the old district boundaries.

Now that we had the partisan breakdown of 2024 voters across the current and old district boundaries, we were able to determine how much the partisan lean changed before and after redistricting. For example, in Congressional District 3, we determined that the new boundaries increased the Democratic share of voters by about 2.2%, while decreasing the Republican share of voters by about 2.5%. This means that the total swing toward Democrats because of redistricting was about 4.7%.

## Analysis:

The findings from this analysis underscore how Democrats have reaped the benefits of redistricting. In six of the seven closest state Assembly races in 2024, Democrats had a redistricting advantage in six of them, while the change in electorate in Congressional District 3 might have contributed to Rep. Susie Lee's narrow victory of less than 3 percent. This means that redistricting likely played a role in Demorats' down-ballot success in Nevada in 2024, even as the state voted for a Republican presiential candidate for the first time in 20 years. At the same time, Democrats fell one seat shy of gain a legislative supermajority in either chamber, which had been a goal of the redistricting in 2021. Our analysis shows that Democrats were disadvantaged by redistricting in both of the Senate and Assembly districts that cost them their chance of a supermajority. This means that although Democrats largely benefitted from redistricting, it was not enough to secure a supermajority, a clearly all order in a purple state such as Nevada.
